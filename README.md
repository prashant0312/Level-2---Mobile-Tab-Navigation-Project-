# Level-2---Mobile-Tab-Navigation-Project-

Take a look at this simple and good looking UI.
Like always, working on HTML CSS is all about figuring out the layout and the structure.

Dividing the whole UI Into Divs (or sections if you want to use HTML5!)
See how they have centred the whole layout and used border radius and shadow
for styling!
    use flexbox for the layout and positioning.
    And select the icons from here: https://fontawesome.com/icons
